This is a simple program to convert a string into an integer without using the function "atoi"
or the library "string.h". The function responsible for the conversion is in "stringToInt.cpp", the algorithm uses the ASCII table to convert the characters into integers. 
The code is well commented explaining step by step the entire process.


To compile and execute the code was created a Makefile to do everything automatically. To compile the code just type, in the terminal, "make" and to run it just type "make exec". To clean both the executable and the object files type "make clean". This makefile will work only on Linux or macOS.
